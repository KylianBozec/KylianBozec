Hello everyone! My name is Kylian Bozec and I'm currently in my second year of computer science engineering school at EPITA. What defines me? Well, I love coding, especially when I work in a team 💪, I love going to the gym at the end of a long day 🏋️ and most importantly, I love drinking tea 🍵and above all, don't forget: There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works.
